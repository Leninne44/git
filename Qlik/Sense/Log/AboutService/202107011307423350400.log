If You\r\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\r\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\r\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\r\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\r\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\r\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\r\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\r\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\r\n      meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\r\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n          stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\r\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\r\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\r\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\r\n          the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\r\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\r\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\r\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\r\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install, copy, or use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.\r\n\r\n1. GRANT OF LICENSE\r\n\r\nIn consideration of your payment of applicable license fees, ComponentSpace hereby grants to you, and you accept, a nonexclusive, nontransferable license for a SINGLE SOFTWARE DEVELOPER to install, use, and display a single copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. You may move the SOFTWARE PRODUCT from one computer to another, and the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may be resident on more than one computer at any one time as long as it is only for the use of a SINGLE SOFTWARE DEVELOPER.\r\n\r\nIf you purchase a MULTI-DEVELOPER license for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, then the EULA extends to include the number of software developers specified by the license.\r\n\r\nIf you purchase a SITE license for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, then the EULA extends to include all software developers within the purchasing organization and located at the same business address or who from time to time telecommute from home or other locations external to the business address.\r\n\r\nIf you purchase an ENTERPRISE license for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, then the EULA extends to include all software developers within the purchasing organization and regardless of their location.\r\n\r\nYou may use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT for the purpose of developing your own software applications, in accordance with the terms of this EULA. A copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may be made for archival or backup purposes as long as it contains all the original SOFTWARE PRODUCT proprietary notices. You may not sublicense, rent, distribute, lease or otherwise transfer or assign any or all of your rights in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. You may use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT solely in its original form, and may not change, alter or modify the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, translate, reverse assemble, reverse compile, disassemble, or in any way reverse engineer the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. If bug fixes, enhancements, or updates to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or new versions of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are made available to and are obtained by you, then they shall become part of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and governed by the terms of this EULA. ComponentSpace reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may assign your rights in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT to any individual or entity that you merge with or into or that acquires substantially all of your assets or stock.\r\n\r\n2. RIGHTS IN SOFTWARE PRODUCT\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge that the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and any copies, regardless of the form or media in which the original or copies may exist, are the sole and exclusive property of ComponentSpace; by accepting this EULA, you do not become the owner of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT recorded on the media. You further acknowledge that the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, including the code, logic and structure of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, contain valuable trade secrets belonging to ComponentSpace. You agree to secure and protect the SOFTWARE PRODUCT consistent with the maintenance of ComponentSpace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, as set forth in this EULA.\r\n\r\n3. COPYRIGHT\r\n\r\nAll title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (including but not limited to any images and text incorporated into the SOFTWARE PRODUCT), the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are owned by ComponentSpace or its suppliers. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions. Therefore, you must treat the SOFTWARE PRODUCT like any other copyrighted material.

CREATING APPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nYou may freely distribute your own applications that use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT as a runtime component (\"Applications\") without payment to ComponentSpace, if and only if the Applications: (a) contain only the runtime component of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT; and (b) contain no modifications to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (including alterations to the original proprietary notices); and (c) do not provide substantially the same functionality as the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or have as one of their purposes to build other software that would compete with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT; and (d) do not reproduce or distribute any portion of the documentation for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or document the Application in a manner that identifies the programmatic interface to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT; and (e) are subject to a license agreement that (i) limits Application end-users use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT to a runtime component, (ii) restricts the Application end-user from changing, altering or modifying the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, creating derivative works, translations, reverse assembling, reverse compiling, disassembling, or in any way reverse engineering the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, and (iii) prevents the Application end-user from sublicensing, renting, distributing, leasing or otherwise transferring or assigning any portion of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT other than as specifically permitted in this EULA.\r\n\r\n5. EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nSolely with respect to those portions of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT identified as example code (\"Example Code\"), ComponentSpace also grants you the right to use and modify the Example Code for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing software product(s), and to reproduce and distribute the Example Code, along with any modifications thereof, provided that you agree to: (A) distribute the Example Code only in conjunction with and as a part of a software application product or Web page developed by you that adds significant and primary functionality or design to the Example Code (\"Application\"); (B) not use ComponentSpace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name, logo, or trademarks to market the Application; (C) include a valid copyright notice on the Application; (D) indemnify, hold harmless, and defend ComponentSpace from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of the Application; (E) not permit further distribution of the Example Code by your end user.\r\n\r\n6. TERM\r\n\r\nThis EULA shall be perpetual unless you fail to observe any of its terms, in which case it shall terminate immediately, and without additional prior notice, provided, however, that copies of the runtime component of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that are part of the Applications licensed to third parties may be retained by such licensed third parties in accordance with this EULA. Upon termination or expiration of this EULA, you shall destroy the original and all copies, complete or partial, of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, and shall not access such media for the purpose of recovering any of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. The terms of Sections 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 shall survive termination of this EULA.\r\n\r\n7. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS\r\n\r\nThe SOFTWARE PRODUCT and documentation are provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. Use, duplication, or disclosure by the Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013 or subparagraphs (c)(1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights at 48 CFR 52.227-19, as applicable. Manufacturer is ComponentSpace/PO Box 420/Robina, QLD 4226/Australia.\r\n\r\n8.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED \"AS-IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND ANY USE OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, ComponentSpace and its suppliers disclaim all warranties AND CONDITIONS, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties AND CONDITIONS of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, with regard to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.\r\n\r\n10. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY\r\n\r\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall ComponentSpace or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, even if ComponentSpace has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall ComponentSpace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liability exceed the price paid to ComponentSpace for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.\r\n\r\n11. INDEMNIFICATION\r\n\r\nYou hereby agree to indemnify ComponentSpace and its officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives from each and every demand, claim, loss, liability, or damage of any kind, including actual attorneys fees, whether in tort or contract, that it or any of them may incur by reason of, or arising out of, any claim which is made by any third party with respect to any breach or violation of this EULA by you or any claims based on the SOFTWARE PRODUCT included therein.\r\n\r\n12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT\r\n\r\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS LICENSE, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU ALSO AGREE THAT THIS LICENSE IS THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN COMPONENTSPACE AND YOU, WHICH SUPERSEDES ANY PROPOSAL, PRIOR AGREEMENT, OR LICENSE, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS EULA.\r\n\r\n13. MISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\nIf any term of this EULA shall be found invalid, the term shall be modified or omitted to the extent necessary, and the remainder of the EULA shall continue in full effect.\r\n\r\n14. GOVERNING LAW\r\n\r\nThis EULA will be governed by the laws in force in the State of Queensland, Australia and all disputes shall have exclusive venue in the federal and state courts in Queensland, and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of these courts."

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n4. Redistribution.\r\n\r\nYou may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.\r\n\r\nYou may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n5. Submission of Contributions.\r\n\r\nUnless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n6. Trademarks.\r\n\r\nThis License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.\r\n\r\nWhile redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n"

Time Zone Database\r\n\r\n  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\r\nDatabase for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database\r\nis explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\r\nDatabase section 7.\r\n\r\n # 7.  Database Ownership\r\n #\r\n #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\r\n #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\r\n #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\r\n #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\r\n #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\r\n #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\r\n #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\r\n #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\r\n #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\r\n #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\r\n #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\r\n #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\r\n #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\r\n \r\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to \r\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the \r\nsoftware is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to \r\nmost of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose \r\nauthors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is \r\ncovered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to \r\nyour programs, too. \r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our \r\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to \r\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), \r\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change \r\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you \r\ncan do these things. \r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny \r\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions \r\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the \r\nsoftware, or if you modify it. \r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for \r\na fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must \r\nmake sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must \r\nshow them these terms so they know their rights. \r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) \r\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute \r\nand/or modify the software. \r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that \r\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the \r\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to \r\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced \r\nby others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. \r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We \r\nwish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will \r\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. \r\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for \r\neveryone's free use or not licensed at all. \r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification \r\nfollow. \r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION \r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice \r\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of \r\nthis General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program \r\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any \r\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the \r\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or \r\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included \r\nwithout limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \r\n\"you\". \r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by \r\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is \r\nnot restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents \r\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by \r\nrunning the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. \r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as \r\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and \r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and \r\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License \r\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the \r\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program. \r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may \r\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. \r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus \r\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications \r\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of \r\nthese conditions: \r\n\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating \r\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change. \r\n\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or \r\n    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be \r\n    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of \r\n    this License. \r\n\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, \r\n    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the \r\n    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an \r\n    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or \r\n    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute \r\n    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy \r\n    of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does \r\n    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is \r\n    not required to print an announcement.) \r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable \r\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably \r\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and \r\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate \r\nworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a \r\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms \r\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire \r\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your \r\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the \r\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on \r\nthe Program. \r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the \r\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or \r\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this \r\nLicense. \r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under \r\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and \r\n2 above provided that you also do one of the following: \r\n\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source \r\n    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above \r\n    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, \r\n\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to \r\n    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically \r\n    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the \r\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 \r\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, \r\n\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to \r\n    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only \r\n    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in \r\n    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with \r\n    Subsection b above.) \r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making \r\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all \r\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface \r\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation \r\nof the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code \r\ndistributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either \r\nsource or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) \r\nof the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component \r\nitself accompanies the executable. \r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy \r\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source \r\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though \r\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. \r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as \r\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, \r\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate \r\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or \r\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so \r\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance. \r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. \r\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program \r\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not \r\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or \r\nany work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to \r\ndo so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying \r\nthe Program or works based on it. \r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), \r\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to \r\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. \r\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the \r\nrights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by \r\nthird parties to this License. \r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent \r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions \r\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that \r\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the \r\nconditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy \r\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent \r\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. \r\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution \r\nof the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through \r\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to \r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program. \r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any \r\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and \r\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or \r\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this \r\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software \r\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many \r\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software \r\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that \r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to \r\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that \r\nchoice. \r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a \r\nconsequence of the rest of this License. \r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain \r\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original \r\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit \r\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that \r\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In \r\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body \r\nof this License. \r\n\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the \r\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in \r\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems \r\nor concerns. \r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program \r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later \r\nversion\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of \r\nthat version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. \r\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may \r\nchoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. \r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs \r\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for \r\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, \r\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. \r\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of \r\nall derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of \r\nsoftware generally. \r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY \r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR \r\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE \r\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE \r\nPROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, \r\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND \r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND \r\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, \r\nYOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. \r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL \r\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE \r\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY \r\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR \r\nINABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA \r\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A \r\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER \r\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS \r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs \r\n\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible \r\nuse to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software \r\nwhich everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. \r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach \r\nthem to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion \r\nof warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a \r\npointer to where the full notice is found. \r\n\r\n    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does. \r\n\r\n    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> \r\n\r\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it \r\n    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free \r\n    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) \r\n    any later version. \r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT \r\n    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or \r\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for \r\n    more details. \r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along \r\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 \r\n    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA \r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. \r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it \r\nstarts in an interactive mode: \r\n\r\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes \r\n    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'. This is free \r\n    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; \r\n    type 'show c' for details. \r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate \r\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be \r\ncalled something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be \r\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. \r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, \r\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here \r\nis a sample; alter the names: \r\n\r\n    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program \r\n    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. \r\n\r\n    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989 \r\n\r\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice \r\n\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into \r\nproprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may \r\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the \r\nlibrary. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public \r\nLicense instead of this License. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL \r\n\r\nCertain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are \r\nsubject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but \r\nonly where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header \r\nthe words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\" \r\nexception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\" \r\n\r\n    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making \r\n    a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of \r\n    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination. \r\n\r\n    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you \r\n    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an \r\n    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, \r\n    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your \r\n    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, \r\n    the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent \r\n    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If \r\n    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of \r\n    the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do \r\n    so, delete this exception statement from your version.\r\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\r\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\r\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\r\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\r\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n \r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n \r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n \r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\r\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\r\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\r\nrights.\r\n \r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\r\n \r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\nauthors' reputations.\r\n \r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\r\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\r\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\r\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n \r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n \r\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n \r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\r\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\r\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n \r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\r\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n \r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\r\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\r\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\r\nalong with the Program.\r\n \r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n \r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n \r\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n \r\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\r\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\r\nparties under the terms of this License.\r\n \r\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\r\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\r\nLicense.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\r\ndoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\r\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n \r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n \r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Program.\r\n \r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\nthe scope of this License.\r\n \r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n \r\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n \r\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\r\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n \r\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\nto distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\r\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such\r\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n \r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\r\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\r\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\r\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\r\nitself accompanies the executable.\r\n \r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\r\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n \r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\r\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\nparties remain in full compliance.\r\n \r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n \r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\nthis License.\r\n \r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n \r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n \r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n \r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n \r\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\r\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\r\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\r\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\r\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n \r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\r\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n \r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\r\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n \r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\r\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\r\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\r\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\r\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n \r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n \r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\r\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\r\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n \r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\r\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\r\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\r\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\r\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\r\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\r\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\r\nitself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\r\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\r\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\nparties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\r\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\r\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\r\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\r\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\r\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\r\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n\r\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\r\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\r\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\r\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\r\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\n                            NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\r\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\r\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\r\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\r\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\r\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\r\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\r\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\r\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\r\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\r\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\r\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\r\n\r\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\r\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\r\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\r\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\r\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\r\nPublic License instead of this License."

The contents \r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and \r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution \r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside \r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided \r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed \r\n          as modifying the License. \r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and \r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions \r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or \r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, \r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with \r\n      the conditions stated in this License. \r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, \r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work \r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of \r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions. \r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify \r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed \r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions. \r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade \r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, \r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the \r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. \r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

You are solely responsible for determining the \r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any \r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. \r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, \r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, \r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly \r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be \r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, \r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a \r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the \r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, \r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all \r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor \r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages. \r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing \r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, \r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, \r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this \r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only \r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf \r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, \r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability \r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason \r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. \r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS \r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work. \r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following \r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\" \r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

For the purposes\r\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\r\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\r\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\r\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\r\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\r\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\r\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\r\n      the copyright owner.

Subject to the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\r\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\r\n      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\r\n      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\r\n      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\r\n\r\n   3. Grant of Patent License.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\r\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\r\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\r\n      meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\r\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n          stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\r\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\r\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\r\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\r\n          the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\r\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\r\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\r\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\r\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee\r\nyour freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free\r\nfor all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\r\n(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General\r\nPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\r\nPublic Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\r\ncopies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive\r\nsource code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use\r\npieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you\r\nthese rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to\r\ncertain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,\r\nyou must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they,\r\ntoo, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know\r\ntheir rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this\r\nlicense which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands\r\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else\r\nand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the\r\ndanger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in\r\neffect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent\r\nmust be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the\r\ncopyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\r\nThe \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\r\ncontaining the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\r\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\r\nin the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\r\nthey are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output\r\nfrom the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\r\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive\r\nit, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy\r\nan appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices\r\nthat refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\r\nof the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option\r\noffer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a\r\nwork based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the\r\nterms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the\r\nfiles and the date of any change.\r\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains\r\nor is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to\r\nall third parties under the terms of this License.\r\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it,\r\nwhen started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty\r\n(or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\r\nProgram itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based\r\non the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work\r\nare not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works\r\nin themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\r\nthem as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\r\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,\r\nwhose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every\r\npart regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written\r\nentirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of\r\nderivative or collective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with\r\na work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the\r\nother work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code\r\nor executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\r\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\r\ninterchange; or,\r\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,\r\nfor a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding\r\nsource code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\r\nFor an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\r\nplus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\r\ninstallation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\r\nnot include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,\r\nunless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated\r\nplace, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\r\nalong with the object code.\r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided\r\nunder this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program\r\nis void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who\r\nhave received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\r\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing\r\nelse grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These\r\nactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or\r\ndistributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of\r\nthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient\r\nautomatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify\r\nthe Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\r\non the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\r\ncompliance by third parties to this License.\r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other\r\nreason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\r\nagreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you\r\nfrom the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\r\nyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\r\nyou may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\r\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or\r\nindirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\r\nbe to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\r\nthe balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply\r\nin other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property\r\nright claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of\r\nprotecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by\r\npublic license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\r\nsoftware distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system;\r\nit is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through\r\nany other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the\r\nrest of this License.\r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by\r\npatents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under\r\nthis License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case,\r\nthis License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public\r\nLicense from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\r\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number\r\nof this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following\r\nthe terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you\r\nmay choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution\r\nconditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\r\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\r\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving\r\nthe free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and\r\nreuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO\r\nTHE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\r\nEXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\r\nAND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\r\nTHE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\r\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,\r\nBE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\r\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES\r\nOR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\r\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

The contents\r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

For the purposes of this definition, \r\n      \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the \r\n      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or \r\n      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the \r\n      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. \r\n\r\n      \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity \r\n      exercising permissions granted by this License. \r\n\r\n      \"Source\" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, \r\n      including but not limited to software source code, documentation \r\n      source, and configuration files. \r\n\r\n      \"Object\" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical \r\n      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but \r\n      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, \r\n      and conversions to other media types. \r\n\r\n      \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or \r\n      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a \r\n      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work \r\n      (an example is provided in the Appendix below). \r\n\r\n      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object \r\n      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the \r\n      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications \r\n      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes \r\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain \r\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, \r\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof. \r\n\r\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including \r\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions \r\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally \r\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner \r\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of \r\n      the copyright owner.

Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of \r\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, \r\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable \r\n      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, \r\n      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the \r\n      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. \r\n\r\n   3.

If You \r\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a \r\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work \r\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct \r\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses \r\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate \r\n      as of the date such litigation is filed. \r\n\r\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the \r\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without \r\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You \r\n      meet the following conditions: \r\n\r\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or \r\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and \r\n\r\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices \r\n          stating that You changed the files; and \r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works \r\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and \r\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, \r\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of \r\n          the Derivative Works; and \r\n\r\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its \r\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must \r\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained \r\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not \r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one \r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed \r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or \r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, \r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and \r\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents \r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and \r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution \r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside \r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided \r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed \r\n          as modifying the License. \r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and \r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions \r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or \r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, \r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with \r\n      the conditions stated in this License. \r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, \r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work \r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of \r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions. \r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify \r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed \r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions. \r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade \r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, \r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the \r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. \r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or \r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each \r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, \r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or \r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions \r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A \r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the \r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any \r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. \r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, \r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, \r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly \r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be \r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, \r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a \r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the \r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, \r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all \r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor \r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages. \r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing \r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, \r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, \r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this \r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only \r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf \r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, \r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability \r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason \r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. \r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS \r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work. \r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following \r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\" \r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Time Zone Database\r\n\r\n      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\r\n    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database\r\n    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\r\n    Database section 7.\r\n\r\n     # 7.  Database Ownership\r\n     #\r\n     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\r\n     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\r\n     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\r\n     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\r\n     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\r\n     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\r\n     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\r\n     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\r\n     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\r\n     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\r\n     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\r\n     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\r\n     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\r\n\r\n    6.

If the\r\n    terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\r\n    make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\r\n    a different licensing arrangement.\r\n\r\n    Definitions\r\n\r\n        \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s)\r\n        named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\r\n\r\n        \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\r\n        material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\r\n        procedures.\r\n\r\n        \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy,\r\n        distribute, or modify the Package.\r\n\r\n        \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the\r\n        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of\r\n        those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard\r\n        Version, or a Modified Version.\r\n\r\n        \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\r\n        accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\r\n        organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\r\n\r\n        \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing\r\n        this Package or providing support for this Package to another\r\n        party.  It does not mean licensing fees.\r\n\r\n        \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been\r\n        modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\r\n        by the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n        \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\r\n        such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\r\n        Holder.\r\n\r\n        \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with\r\n        the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\r\n        it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\r\n\r\n        \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\r\n        configuration files for the Package.\r\n\r\n        \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\r\n        or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\r\n        translation of the Source form.\r\n\r\n    Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\r\n\r\n    (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\r\n    Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\r\n    you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\r\n\r\n    Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\r\n\r\n    (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\r\n    Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\r\n    either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\r\n    all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\r\n    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\r\n    Compiled form of the Package.\r\n\r\n    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\r\n    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\r\n    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\r\n    will be subject to the Original License.\r\n\r\n    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\r\n\r\n    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\r\n    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\r\n    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\r\n    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\r\n    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\r\n    you do at least ONE of the following:\r\n\r\n        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\r\n        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\r\n        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\r\n        Version.\r\n\r\n        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\r\n        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\r\n        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\r\n        from the name of the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\r\n        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\r\n        under\r\n\r\n            (i)  the Original License or\r\n\r\n            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\r\n            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\r\n            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\r\n            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\r\n            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\r\n            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\r\n            Fees are allowed.\r\n\r\n    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\r\n    or Modified Versions without the Source\r\n\r\n    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\r\n    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\r\n    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\r\n    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\r\n    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\r\n    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\r\n    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\r\n    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\r\n    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\r\n\r\n    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\r\n    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\r\n    the Source of the Modified Version.\r\n\r\n    Aggregating or Linking the Package\r\n\r\n    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\r\n    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\r\n    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\r\n    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\r\n    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\r\n    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\r\n    as included in the aggregation.\r\n\r\n    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\r\n    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\r\n    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\r\n    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\r\n    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\r\n\r\n    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\r\n\r\n    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\r\n    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\r\n    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\r\n    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\r\n    terms of this license.\r\n\r\n    General Provisions\r\n\r\n    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\r\n    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\r\n    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\r\n    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\r\n    license.\r\n\r\n    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\r\n    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\r\n    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\r\n    this license.\r\n\r\n    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\r\n    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\r\n    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\r\n    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\r\n    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\r\n    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\r\n    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\r\n    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\r\n    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\r\n    date that such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\r\n    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\r\n    IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.

UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL\r\n    BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\r\n    DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF\r\n    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\r\n\r\n    --------\r\n\r\n---\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n\r\n- GYP, located at tools/gyp, is licensed as follows:\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n    Copyright (c) 2009 Google Inc.

The contents\r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n   Copyright (c) Donald Stufft and individual contributors.\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n    1.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License.

In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License.

If You \r\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a \r\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work \r\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct \r\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses \r\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate \r\n      as of the date such litigation is filed. \r\n\r\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the \r\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without \r\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You \r\n      meet the following conditions: \r\n\r\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or \r\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and \r\n\r\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices \r\n          stating that You changed the files; and \r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works \r\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and \r\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, \r\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of \r\n          the Derivative Works; and \r\n\r\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its \r\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must \r\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained \r\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not \r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one \r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed \r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or \r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, \r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and \r\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents \r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and \r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution \r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside \r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided \r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed \r\n          as modifying the License. \r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and \r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions \r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or \r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, \r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with \r\n      the conditions stated in this License. \r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, \r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work \r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of \r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions. \r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify \r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed \r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions. \r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade \r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, \r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the \r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. \r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or \r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each \r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, \r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or \r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions \r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A \r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the \r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any \r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. \r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, \r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, \r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly \r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be \r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, \r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a \r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the \r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, \r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all \r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor \r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages. \r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing \r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, \r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, \r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this \r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only \r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf \r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, \r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability \r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason \r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. \r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS \r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work. \r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following \r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\" \r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\r\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\r\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\r\n      identification within third-party archives.\r\n\r\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n"

If You\r\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\r\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\r\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\r\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\r\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\r\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\r\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\r\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\r\n      meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\r\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n          stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\r\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\r\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\r\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\r\n          the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\r\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\r\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\r\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\r\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\r\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\r\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\r\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\r\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\r\n      identification within third-party archives.\r\n\r\n   Copyright 2016-2018, Andrew Svetlov and aio-libs team\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n"
